# ShoppingAssistant

In this Excel-Project an Excel Application of a Shopping Assistant is designed which can simplify meal planning and grocery shopping.

From a list of 11 meal categories (e.g. vegan üçÉ) meals can be chosen. After specifying the number of servings and selecting the currency, the tool automatically generates a comprehensive shopping list.
The resulting list includes all the necessary ingredients, their quantities, and estimated prices. 

Below you can see the User Interface.
